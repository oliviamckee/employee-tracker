# Employee Tracker 

## Description 
I created this application using NodeJS, the inquirer and cTable packages, and a mySQL database to make managing a company with multiple departments, roles within those departments, and a multitude of employees easier. You can easily track all of these positions and their salaries as well as the manager to whom everyone reports.

## Installation
Navigate to the github directory, download all relevent files, as well as NodeJS, mySQL, the inquirer npm package, and the cTable package. You will also have to create a database titled employee_tracker and populate it with the tables in my seeds.sql file. I have basic seed data in that file as well, but you may use your own business's information. 

## Usage 
Start the application by typing "node app" into the command line. My walkthrough was done using the seed data from my seeds file, so yours may look different.
